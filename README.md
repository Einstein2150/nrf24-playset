# python3 compatible nRF24 Playset

The nRF24 Playset is a collection of software tools for wireless input
devices like keyboards, mice, and presenters based on Nordic Semiconductor 
nRF24 transceivers, e.g. nRF24LE1 and nRF24LU1+.

All software tools support USB dongles with the
[nrf-research-firmware](https://github.com/BastilleResearch/nrf-research-firmware)
by the Bastille Threat Research Team (many thanks to @marcnewlin)


## Migration from Python 2 to Python 3

This project has been migrated from Python 2 to Python 3. The codebase has been thoroughly updated to take advantage of Python 3's features, syntax improvements, and enhanced libraries. Users should ensure that they are using a Python 3.x interpreter to run the script. Compatibility with Python 2 is no longer supported, and users are encouraged to upgrade their environments accordingly.
 

## Requirements

- nRF24LU1+ USB radio dongle with flashed python3 compatible [nrf-research-firmware](https://github.com/Einstein2150/nrf-research-firmware) 
	* [Bitcraze CrazyRadio PA USB dongle](https://www.bitcraze.io/crazyradio-pa/)
	* Logitech Unifying dongle (model C-U0007, Nordic Semiconductor based)
- Python3
- PyUSB
- PyGame for GUI-based tools


## Tools


### cherry_attack.py v.1.1 by Einstein2150

Proof-of-concept software tool to demonstrate the replay and keystroke injection
vulnerabilities of the wireless keyboard Cherry B.Unlimited AES

#### New commandline Features

The `-key` parameter specifies the cryptographic key used for the Cherry keyboard. It must be provided in a hex format (16 bytes) without spaces or special characters

The `-hex` parameter specifies the device address of the Cherry keyboard. This address must also be in hex format (5 bytes) and formatted similarly to the key, with pairs of hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., 00:11:22:33:44).

The `-p` or `--payload` parameter allows users to pass a custom payload that will be used during the attack. This gives users more flexibility when conducting their tests and attacks.

The new `-x` or `--execute` option allows users to execute an attack immediately without using the application's user interface. When both the `-p` (payload) and `-x` options are provided at startup, the attack is executed with the supplied payload right away.

**Example:**

```
bash
python cherry_attack.py -key 1234567890123456789012 -hex 00:11:22:33:44 -p "Your custom payload" -x
```

#### New insights in cherrys encryption

During testing with the extensions, I [@Einstein2150](https://github.com/Einstein2150) also noticed that multiple valid keys for keystroke injection can be concurrently valid at the same time. With the enhanced debugging output, the keys along with their corresponding device MAC addresses are documented as entries in the log. Feel free to collect as many working keys for your device as you can.
